##Description of Assignments##

**Class Blog**—7 posts total due every two weeks by 10 pm on Friday.
Due Dates: 9/7, 9/12, 10/5, 10/19, 11/2, 11/16, 11/30

To complete the blogging portion of our coursework, each student must complete seven (7) blog posts throughout the semester. That is less than one post every two weeks so it is no daunting task. In addition to the seven posts, you must also contribute at least 14 comments on the posts of other students. Yes, commenting means that you must read the writing of others. The comments should be thoughtful and insightful. It is not sufficient to write, “I like what you have there. Good job,” and expect full credit.
The blog posts should be no shorter than 200 words and should provide some analysis or thoughts on outside texts (not just written texts!) that are relevant to our work. This means that you should frequently scour news sites for articles that you feel would be good spring boards for an interesting blog post. I do not expect expert level analysis, but I want you to demonstrate that you are grappling with the text. If your blog post is full of questions, that’s just fine! Those types of posts often elicit tons of comments and we like comments. It is also perfectly fine to carry on some sort of conversation in the comments–that’s what why we comment!
All in all, the blogging process is not meant to be difficult or mundane. It’s a time for you to connect with your classmates and discuss things on your own terms. Of course, I’ll expect you to use SAE grammar but this is your space to do with what you will. Please do contact me with any questions.
In addition to weekly blogging, you will complete a blog self-audit around mid-term to analyze your own writing style. The audit will require you to re-read all of your blog posts up to that point and write a 500-word blog post about your blog posts. The blog audit will be worth 25% of your blogging grade.

2	Underdeveloped. The journal entry is mostly description or summary, without consideration of alternative perspectives, and few connections are made between ideas. The entry reflects passing engagement with the topic.
