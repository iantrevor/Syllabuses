##Class Policies##

**Attendance**
If a student misses two weeks’ worth of classes—4 classes—and/or misses a week’s worth of classes consecutively without contacting the instructor, the instructor will drop the student from the course. When dropping a student for non-attendance, the instructor will assign a WF, WP, or W, as appropriate. Note: arriving late or leaving class early counts as 1/3 of an absence, thus 3 tardies =  1 absence.
N.B: If you are absent, it is your responsibility to find out what you missed from a classmate and turn in any assignments that may have be due. Late assignments due to absence will not be accepted.

**Problems with the Course**
Be sure to talk with me as soon as possible if you are having any problems with this course. If you believe the outcome is unjustified, you may contact the director of First-Year Writing, 501.450.3345.

**Digital Etiquette Policy**
*Phones &c.: 
This should go without saying, but let’s say it anyway: you should turn off your cellphone and/or other devices (iPods, &c) before you enter the classroom. Do not text/read texts (this includes FB, Twitter, &c.) during our class meetings. If you use your phones in class improperly, I will be forced to confiscate your phone and/or ask you to leave class. I understand that your phones connect you with your friends and family, but the classroom should be a place apart, however briefly, from the outside world. You will learn more, in short, if you can concentrate on the course while you’re in the course. 

*Laptops: 
You may use a laptop to take notes during this class. Indeed, there will be times when I will call on students with laptops to look up facts &c. during class. However, in-class laptops also present temptations that many students find irresistible. You should not use a laptop during class to follow a game, check your friends’ statuses on Facebook, IM, respond to email, &c. Such activities not only distract you, they also distract anyone around or behind you. If you often seem distracted by what’s on your screen, I will ask you to put your laptop away.

**Technology Policy**
Hard drives crash, the power goes out, printers run out of ink. Face it: things break. It is your responsibility to back-up copies of all your work in this course. I suggest using Dropbox, Google Drive, or SpiderOak, but a USB flash drive works well too. You may not use digitally lost work or printer/BearBucks issues as an excuse for late work. 

**Late Work**
Homework and quizzes will not be accepted late. Essays (excluding the final essay) will be accepted up to one week late but will lose 5% per day late. Note: weekends and holidays count toward deductions. A major assignment that is not turned in will result in an automatic F in the course. Yes, you must turn in every graded essay to pass the course.

**Evaluations**
Student evaluations of a course and its professor are a crucial element in helping faculty achieve excellence in the classroom and the institution in demonstrating that students are gaining knowledge. Students may evaluate courses they are taking starting on the Monday of the twelfth week of instruction (November 12th) through the end of finals week by logging in to myUCA and clicking on the Evals button on the top right.

**Plagiarism**
Plagiarism is the intentional or unintentional borrowing or stealing of another’s words, thoughts, or ideas and passing them off as your own. If a student turns in a paper that includes an extended passage that has been a) written for him or her by someone else for pay or as a favor, or b) copied from a print or electronic source written by another author, even if some of the words have been changed, that student may immediately be dropped from the course, receiving a WF grade. 

**Academic Integrity Statement**
The University of Central Arkansas affirms its commitment to academic integrity and expects all members of the university community to accept shared responsibility for maintaining academic integrity. Students in this course are subject to the provisions of the university’s Academic Integrity Policy, approved by the Board of Trustees as Board Policy No. 709 on February 10, 2010, and published in the Student Handbook. Penalties for academic misconduct in this course may include a failing grade on an assignment, a failing grade in the course, or any other course-related sanction the instructor determines to be appropriate. Continued enrollment in this course affirms a student’s acceptance of this university policy.

**Disruptive Behavior**
Any student whose behavior regularly interferes with the instructor’s ability to conduct the class and foster student learning may be dropped from the course.

**Sexual Harassment Policy**
Sexual harassment by any faculty member, staff member, or student is a violation of both law and university policy and will not be tolerated at the University of Central Arkansas. Sexual harassment of employees is prohibited under Section 703 of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and sexual harassment of students may constitute discrimination under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. Please see the Student Handbook and University Bulletin for more information.

**Other University Policies**
It is your responsibility to be aware of all of the university policies, so I encourage you to read your Student Handbook and University Bulletin carefully. You might pay particular attention to the academic policies.

**Disabilities**
The University of Central Arkansas adheres to the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act. If you need an accommodation under this Act due to a disability, please contact the UCA Office of Disability Services, 501.450.3613. 

**AfterWords**
AfterWords is a university-sponsored academic event held every year. It is both a writing competition and a student reading held among Residential College students enrolled in Writing 1310 each fall.  The writing competition provides a real incentive and reward for good student writing by offering students the opportunity to share their writing with students from other classes, to learn from each other, and have their hard work recognized and praised by peers and faculty.  
All writing faculty who teach RC sections of 1310 will nominate student essays for the writing competition (time line TBA). All nominees will participate in the event by reading their nominated piece of writing to a student audience.  Nominated essays will be judged anonymously by writing department faculty, and winners will be announced at the end of the day-long event when prizes will be awarded.
Participation
Your attendance is required in both senses of the word. That means you must be physically and mentally present. This course is discussion-based so the more you participate, the better the class will be. If you are not fully present for class (sleeping, frequently disrupting, lacking necessary tools for class [i.e. books, articles, writing materials], etc.) you will be asked to leave and lost participation points.
