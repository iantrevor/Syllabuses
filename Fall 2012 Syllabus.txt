**Course Catalogue Description**
Part of the general education program and required of all students during the first semester they are eligible to 
enroll. This course introduces students to the writing process, focusing on audience, invention, and arrangement, and 
will be conducted as a workshop. Prerequisite: ACT score of 19 or higher or completion of UNIV 1300 with a grade of C 
or higher. Fall, spring, summer.

**Our Description**
This semester we will be reading and writing about a variety of topics. My hope is that you are able to find a topic 
that interests you and run with it. The primary goal of higher education is to foster the quest for truth and 
knowledge. Such a quest must be driven by your own interest and curiosity. The goal of this class is for you to engage in texts of all sorts and be able to communicate your ideas to a broad audience.

**Why Take Comp I?**
Beyond being required as part of a liberal arts education, this course will sharpen your command of written language and hone your analytical skills to make you a better student, a more desirable employee, and—most importantly—a better human being. We will emphasize critical thinking, communication, and creativity to create writing that is insightful, unique, and relevant.

##Description of Assignments##

**Class Blog**—7 posts total due every two weeks by 10 pm on Friday.
Due Dates: 9/7, 9/12, 10/5, 10/19, 11/2, 11/16, 11/30

To complete the blogging portion of our coursework, each student must complete seven (7) blog posts throughout the semester. That is less than one post every two weeks so it is no daunting task. In addition to the seven posts, you must also contribute at least 14 comments on the posts of other students. Yes, commenting means that you must read the writing of others. The comments should be thoughtful and insightful. It is not sufficient to write, “I like what you have there. Good job,” and expect full credit.
The blog posts should be no shorter than 200 words and should provide some analysis or thoughts on outside texts (not just written texts!) that are relevant to our work. This means that you should frequently scour news sites for articles that you feel would be good spring boards for an interesting blog post. I do not expect expert level analysis, but I want you to demonstrate that you are grappling with the text. If your blog post is full of questions, that’s just fine! Those types of posts often elicit tons of comments and we like comments. It is also perfectly fine to carry on some sort of conversation in the comments–that’s what why we comment!
All in all, the blogging process is not meant to be difficult or mundane. It’s a time for you to connect with your classmates and discuss things on your own terms. Of course, I’ll expect you to use SAE grammar but this is your space to do with what you will. Please do contact me with any questions.
In addition to weekly blogging, you will complete a blog self-audit around mid-term to analyze your own writing style. The audit will require you to re-read all of your blog posts up to that point and write a 500-word blog post about your blog posts. The blog audit will be worth 25% of your blogging grade.

Blog Assessment
Rating		Characteristics
4	Exceptional. The journal entry is focused and coherently integrates examples with explanations or analysis. The entry demonstrates awareness of its own limitations or implications, and it considers multiple perspectives when appropriate. The entry reflects in-depth engagement with the topic.

3	Satisfactory. The journal entry is reasonably focused, and explanations or analysis are mostly based on examples or other evidence. Fewer connections are made between ideas, and though new insights are offered, they are not fully developed. The entry reflects moderate engagement with the topic.

2	Underdeveloped. The journal entry is mostly description or summary, without consideration of alternative perspectives, and few connections are made between ideas. The entry reflects passing engagement with the topic.

1	Limited. The journal entry is unfocused, or simply rehashes previous comments, and displays no evidence of student engagement with the topic.

0		No Credit. The journal entry is missing or consists of one or two disconnected sentences.
 
**Essay 1: Narrative**
Construct a descriptive narrative essay using a word processing tool. The purpose of this essay is to afford you personal space to retell a significant event in your life. This story does not need to be life-changing or particularly dramatic, but it should have caused you to consider something differently.

**Essay 2: Analysis/Review**
Construct a digital essay using the class blog (through Wordpress) as the writing tool. The purpose of this essay is to engage with texts related to your chosen topic and persuasively present your opinion. 

In lieu of a standard Works Cited page, you will construct a Storify story of the various online sources that informed your essay.

**Essay 3: Persuasive**
Construct a persuasive essay using a word processing tool. This essay will be a minimum of 5 pages in standard, MLA format. We will develop your topic together in class. This essay will serve as your final exam and will be returned during the exam period.

**Final Exam**
The final essay will be your final exam. You will submit the essay on December 7th.

##Class Policies##

**Attendance**
If a student misses two weeks’ worth of classes—4 classes—and/or misses a week’s worth of classes consecutively without contacting the instructor, the instructor will drop the student from the course. When dropping a student for non-attendance, the instructor will assign a WF, WP, or W, as appropriate. Note: arriving late or leaving class early counts as 1/3 of an absence, thus 3 tardies =  1 absence.
N.B: If you are absent, it is your responsibility to find out what you missed from a classmate and turn in any assignments that may have be due. Late assignments due to absence will not be accepted.

**Problems with the Course**
Be sure to talk with me as soon as possible if you are having any problems with this course. If you believe the outcome is unjustified, you may contact the director of First-Year Writing, 501.450.3345.

**Digital Etiquette Policy**
*Phones &c.: 
This should go without saying, but let’s say it anyway: you should turn off your cellphone and/or other devices (iPods, &c) before you enter the classroom. Do not text/read texts (this includes FB, Twitter, &c.) during our class meetings. If you use your phones in class improperly, I will be forced to confiscate your phone and/or ask you to leave class. I understand that your phones connect you with your friends and family, but the classroom should be a place apart, however briefly, from the outside world. You will learn more, in short, if you can concentrate on the course while you’re in the course. 

*Laptops: 
You may use a laptop to take notes during this class. Indeed, there will be times when I will call on students with laptops to look up facts &c. during class. However, in-class laptops also present temptations that many students find irresistible. You should not use a laptop during class to follow a game, check your friends’ statuses on Facebook, IM, respond to email, &c. Such activities not only distract you, they also distract anyone around or behind you. If you often seem distracted by what’s on your screen, I will ask you to put your laptop away.

**Technology Policy**
Hard drives crash, the power goes out, printers run out of ink. Face it: things break. It is your responsibility to back-up copies of all your work in this course. I suggest using Dropbox, Google Drive, or SpiderOak, but a USB flash drive works well too. You may not use digitally lost work or printer/BearBucks issues as an excuse for late work. 

**Late Work**
Homework and quizzes will not be accepted late. Essays (excluding the final essay) will be accepted up to one week late but will lose 5% per day late. Note: weekends and holidays count toward deductions. A major assignment that is not turned in will result in an automatic F in the course. Yes, you must turn in every graded essay to pass the course.

**Evaluations**
Student evaluations of a course and its professor are a crucial element in helping faculty achieve excellence in the classroom and the institution in demonstrating that students are gaining knowledge. Students may evaluate courses they are taking starting on the Monday of the twelfth week of instruction (November 12th) through the end of finals week by logging in to myUCA and clicking on the Evals button on the top right.

**Plagiarism**
Plagiarism is the intentional or unintentional borrowing or stealing of another’s words, thoughts, or ideas and passing them off as your own. If a student turns in a paper that includes an extended passage that has been a) written for him or her by someone else for pay or as a favor, or b) copied from a print or electronic source written by another author, even if some of the words have been changed, that student may immediately be dropped from the course, receiving a WF grade. 

**Academic Integrity Statement**
The University of Central Arkansas affirms its commitment to academic integrity and expects all members of the university community to accept shared responsibility for maintaining academic integrity. Students in this course are subject to the provisions of the university’s Academic Integrity Policy, approved by the Board of Trustees as Board Policy No. 709 on February 10, 2010, and published in the Student Handbook. Penalties for academic misconduct in this course may include a failing grade on an assignment, a failing grade in the course, or any other course-related sanction the instructor determines to be appropriate. Continued enrollment in this course affirms a student’s acceptance of this university policy.

**Disruptive Behavior**
Any student whose behavior regularly interferes with the instructor’s ability to conduct the class and foster student learning may be dropped from the course.

**Sexual Harassment Policy**
Sexual harassment by any faculty member, staff member, or student is a violation of both law and university policy and will not be tolerated at the University of Central Arkansas. Sexual harassment of employees is prohibited under Section 703 of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and sexual harassment of students may constitute discrimination under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. Please see the Student Handbook and University Bulletin for more information.

**Other University Policies**
It is your responsibility to be aware of all of the university policies, so I encourage you to read your Student Handbook and University Bulletin carefully. You might pay particular attention to the academic policies.

**Disabilities**
The University of Central Arkansas adheres to the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act. If you need an accommodation under this Act due to a disability, please contact the UCA Office of Disability Services, 501.450.3613. 

**AfterWords**
AfterWords is a university-sponsored academic event held every year. It is both a writing competition and a student reading held among Residential College students enrolled in Writing 1310 each fall.  The writing competition provides a real incentive and reward for good student writing by offering students the opportunity to share their writing with students from other classes, to learn from each other, and have their hard work recognized and praised by peers and faculty.  
All writing faculty who teach RC sections of 1310 will nominate student essays for the writing competition (time line TBA). All nominees will participate in the event by reading their nominated piece of writing to a student audience.  Nominated essays will be judged anonymously by writing department faculty, and winners will be announced at the end of the day-long event when prizes will be awarded.
Participation
Your attendance is required in both senses of the word. That means you must be physically and mentally present. This course is discussion-based so the more you participate, the better the class will be. If you are not fully present for class (sleeping, frequently disrupting, lacking necessary tools for class [i.e. books, articles, writing materials], etc.) you will be asked to leave and lost participation points.
